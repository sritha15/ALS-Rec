# ALS-Rec

This is a samll mini project that I did to build a recommendation system for recommending moisturizers to users using collaborative filtering.
The dataset I have used is a sephora dataset. For testing purposes, currently working on building my own dataset to test the performance of the recommendation system using RMSE/MSE. Given the Author_ID (user), the recommendation systems gives a top 5 product_ids that can be used to retrive the top 5 recommendations for a user based on similar users preferences. This recommendation system doesn't solve the cold start problem yet, which I am about to experiment using LLama 2 to deal with a cold strat problem.
