# ALS-Rec

I did This small mini-project to build a recommendation system for recommending moisturizers to users using collaborative filtering.
The dataset I have used is a Sephora dataset. For testing purposes, I am currently building my dataset to test the performance of the recommendation system using RMSE/MSE. Given the Author_ID (user), the recommendation system gives a top 5 product_id that can be used to retrieve the top 5 recommendations for a user based on similar user preferences. This recommendation system doesn't solve the cold start problem yet, and I am about to experiment with using LLama 2 to deal with a cold start problem.
